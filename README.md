# Modern datatables

## Concept Overview

This project shows how to build a **modern** real life application with in two different ways.

They are many ways to build **reactive** web interfaces but do we really need to add the complexity of JavaScript frameworks like [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) or [React](https://reactjs.org/)?

These tools are very powerful but the complexity they add to a full-stack developer's workflow is **INSANE**.

In this repo, you'll find two apps:

ðŸ‘‰ One is build with [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [Hotwire](https://hotwire.dev/) aka NEW MAGIC.

ðŸ‘‰ The other with Rails as a backend API and Vue.js as a full static SPA in the frontend.

They have the exact same features and level of responsiveness.

ðŸ‘‰ Here is a blog post with some details of how it works under the hood: https://guillaumebriday.fr/hotwire-reactive-search-form-without-javascript

ðŸ‘‰ You can already use [Stimulus Rails Auto Submit](https://www.stimulus-components.com/docs/stimulus-auto-submit) to auto-submit your forms with Stimulus without writing a single line of custom JavaScript.

## Demo

Both example are available online ðŸ¥³:

- [https://rails-vuejs.guillaumebriday.fr](https://rails-vuejs.guillaumebriday.fr)

## Resources

More and more developers come back from building dedicated SPAs and just want to use the power of Vue or React in a classic Backend application.

Many projects help you in multiples frameworks:

- [Hotwire](https://hotwire.dev/)
- [Laravel Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/)
- [htmx](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx)
- [Inertiajs](https://inertiajs.com/)
- [Stimulus Reflex](https://docs.stimulusreflex.com/)
- [Phoenix Live_View](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view)
- [Turbolinks](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks)

If you're still perplex about this old school approach, you should watch this video from Sam Stephenson:
